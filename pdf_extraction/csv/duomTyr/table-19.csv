"'Laboratory works","'50%","'During the semester (according to the timetable given at the beginning of the semester)","'The students must perform 4 practical tasks, present the reports, and defend them individually by answering the questions asked. 9-10 points - the report satisfies all the necessary requirements: the report structure is clear and logical, there are all the necessary parts (work aim, tasks, description of experiments, results, conclusions), the report is properly formatted, the analysis of the results is comprehensive, the conclusions are reasoned, the student answers all questions asked. 7-8 points - all the required parts of the report are presented (work aim, tasks, description of experiments, results, conclusions), but there are shortcomings: not all parts of the report are properly formatted, there are logical errors, the analysis of the results is not sufficiently detailed, not all the conclusions are justified, and the student does not answer all the questions asked. 5-6 points - not all the necessary parts of the report are presented, the analysis is superficial and fragmentary, not all the conclusions are justified, there are fundamental logical errors, the student is not able to answer all the essential questions. 1-4 points - the report is poorly structured, it has a large number of fundamental errors, the student does not answer the questions. 0 points - the report is not presented, or it is not defended. A student is considered to have completed the practical task when the report is uploaded to the system and defended. If the delay is 2 weeks, the grade is reduced by 2 points; if the delay is 3 weeks, the grade is reduced by 3 points. Thereafter the practical task will not be evaluated. Practical tasks must be submitted no later than the last practical lecture.",
"'Activeness (discussion) during lectures and laboratory works","'10%","'Each week of the semester","'Activeness during each lecture or laboratory work is evaluated maximum up to 1 point. The total mark is derived by summing the points above and dividing by maximal possible number of lectures and laboratory works.",
"'Exam","'40%","'During exam session","'In the exam, students answer 3 questions. To take the exam is possible only for the student which has successfully defended all semester exercises during lectures and laboratory works and has the total sum of marks for laboratory works and activeness not less than 2.",
